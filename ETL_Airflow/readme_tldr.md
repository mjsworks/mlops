## Project Description
In this project, I will be taking data from an API. I will transform that into a JSON file and then load that into a postgres sevrer.

I will be taking Airflow using Astronomer to run the ETL pipeline.

For the sake of the project, let's assume: we will be gathering new data every week.
To trigger the process in this manner, we need something like Airflow.
